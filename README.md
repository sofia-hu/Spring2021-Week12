# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week11: Deep Learning - Part2

We will first complete the CNN example, and review few major components of DL models, with examples. We will learn how to adapt a pre-trained model to a new problem. Finally we will see an example of a sligthly more complex network architecture.

- [SHIPS segmented using a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN)](DLBasics_SHIPS.ipynb)

- [Using pre-trained models](DLBasics_TransferLearning.ipynb)
- [An example for a more complex architecture using Keras](DL_Keras_SiameseNet_MNIST.ipynb)
