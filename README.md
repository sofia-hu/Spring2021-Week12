# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week12: Deep Learning - Part3

We will first learn transfer learning, a technique used for adapting a pre-trained model to a new problem. We will then review few specialized architectures, auto-encoders for unsupervised learning, and UNet for image segmentation problems. We will see an example of a sligthly more complex network architecture, Siamese network, and discuss adverserial networks.
